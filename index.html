		<h2>Pro Plus 36 is a Varidesk best seller</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="section-one">
		<p>Why is Pro Plus 36 such a crowd pleaser? Well, lots and lots of reasons, actually. Overall, customers tell us it's because they want to buy a standing desk that's "just right" in size, price, and design.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>First, they like the 36-inch display surface that’s
					wide enough for two monitors plus some papers
					and things.</li>
					<li>The two-tier design is also popular because lots of
					people like a desk that has a keyboard tray and
					mouse desk that sits a little lower than the display
					surface.</li>
					<li>$350 (Get Pro Plus 36) And then there’s the
					reasonable price as well as all the usual good
					stuff thats comes with owning a VARIDESK:</li>

		<h1>Embrace change</h1>
		<h2>Pro Plus 36 is fully adjustable to 11 different heights</h2>

		<p>Sitting all day ... standing all day ... it’s really the “all day” part that’s the problem. Staying in one, static position for too long is never good for you. Changing it up is the key. When you buy a standing desk that’s height-adjustable, it gives you the freedom to sit or stand any time you like, as often as you like - and VARIDESK makes it easy!</p>

		<h2 id="simple">It's as simple as this:</h2>
		<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="images/II_griphandles.png" width="381px" height="344px">
		</p>
		<p>To raise or lower your VARIDESK, just lightly grasp the quick-release handles and gently pull up or push down - the spring-assisted lift does most of the work for you. Changing positions is super easy, smooth as glass, and it only takes 3 seconds. No need to complicate things with buttons, gears, or electrical parts.</p>

		<h1>Give your old desk new life</h1>
		<h2>Pro plus 36 converts your current desk into a sit/stand desk</h2>
		<p>When you purchase a VARIDESK, you get to keep the desk you already have and get a brand new sit/stand desk at the same time - without rearranging your office or shelling out tons of cash for a big, expensive piece of furniture. It’s the best of both worlds! (and in both of those worlds; you’re happier, healthier and saving money)</p>
		<h2>To make sure the Pro Plus 36 is the right size for you:</h2>
		<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="images/III_desk_measurements.png" width="386px" height="300px">
		</p>
		<p>Measure your desktop and consider how many monitors and accessories you’ll need space for. As long as the bottom feet of the VARIDESK will fit on the surface of your current desk, you’re in business.</p>

		<p>Wouldn’t it be great if you could buy a standing desk online and have it arrive fully assembled and ready-to-use right out of the box? Yeah, we think so too. We worked really hard to design VARIDESK to be as hassle-free as possible. Pro Plus 36 lets you go from box, to desk, to planning your next presentation in no time:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><img src="images/IV_truck.png" width="66px" height="42px">Ding dong! Your VARIDESK has arrived! Seems like you just ordered it yesterday...</li>
			<li><img src="images/IV_2people.png" width="66px" height="42px">Get a buddy to help you pull it out of the box and place it on top of your current desk.</li>
			<li><img src="images/IV_monitor.png" width="66px" height="42px">Place monitors, keyboard, mouse, and other stuff on top.</li>
			<li><img src="images/IV_wire.png" width="66px" height="42px">Make sure wires are long enough to reach standing height.</li>
			<li><img src="images/IV_pixelhand.png" width="66px" height="42px">Start writing, coding, emailing, designing, surfing, or whatever it is you do!</li>
